I have prepared the project for testing. I have created a test file and configured the `package.json`.

However, I am unable to run the final commands to install the dependencies and run the tests due to my current limitations.

Please run the following commands in your terminal:

1.  `npm install`
2.  `npm test`

After you run these commands, please paste the output here, and I will analyze it for you.
